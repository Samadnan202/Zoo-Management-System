# Zoo-Management-System project

Hi my name is Adnan,

The small description of my project:-

**Work of technology**

**1.HTML,CSS,JAVAscript:**

   Upon accessing the booking section, users are greeted with an intuitive interface where they can select their desired date and 
time of visit, as well as the number of tickets required. The system dynamically updates ticket availability based on real-time data,
ensuring accurate information for users.

**2.Java Servlets,Java Server Page(jsp):**

   Java Servlets manage the backend logic, handling user requests and processing booking transactions securely. 
Utilizing JavaServer Pages (JSP), dynamic content is generated to provide users with confirmation of their booking, 
along with relevant details such as ticket numbers and total cost.

**3.Oracle Database:**

   Behind the scenes, an Oracle database efficiently stores and manages booking information, ensuring data integrity and seamless retrieval.
This allows zoo administrators to track visitor bookings, monitor attendance trends, and optimize resource allocation.

**NOTE:**
       Overall, the ticket booking facility integrated into the Zoo Management System offers visitors a convenient way to plan 
    their zoo experience while providing administrators with valuable insights to enhance operational efficiency.

**Admin Section:**

1.View Tickets:
        Administrators can access a dedicated interface to view all ticket bookings made by users. Using HTML and CSS, 
     a tabular layout can display essential details such as ticket ID, user information, booking date, and ticket status. 
     JavaScript can enhance the interface by 

2.  Update Tickets:
        To update ticket data, administrators can leverage Java Servlets to handle user requests. HTML forms can be used to capture
     updated information such as user details or ticket status changes. Servlets process these form submissions, updating the
     corresponding entries in the Oracle database accordingly. JavaScript can provide client-side validation to ensure data 
     integrity before submission.

3.Delete Tickets: 
        Administrators may need the ability to delete ticket entries when necessary. This functionality can be implemented using 
     Java Servlets to handle delete requests from the admin interface. Upon confirmation, Servlets interact with the Oracle database 
     to remove the selected ticket entries securely.  

 4.Admin Authentication and Authorization: 
        To ensure security, the admin section should incorporate user authentication and authorization mechanisms. Administrators can 
     log in using their credentials, with Java Servlets verifying the login details against stored admin accounts. Once authenticated, 
     access control can be enforced to restrict unauthorized users from accessing or modifying ticket data. 

 5.Error Handling and Feedback: 
        Proper error handling should be implemented throughout the admin section to provide meaningful feedback to administrators. 
     Java Servlets can generate appropriate error messages in case of invalid inputs or database errors. JavaScript can enhance 
     the user experience by displaying feedback messages dynamically on the admin interface.    

**NOTE:**
       By integrating these features, the admin section of the Zoo Management System empowers administrators to efficiently view, update, 
    and delete user ticket data, ensuring smooth operations and optimal management of resources.
